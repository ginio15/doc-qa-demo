            <h1>Global Warming Visualization Dashboard</h1>
            <p>This dashboard presents visualizations of global temperature trends from 1880 to 2025, highlighting the evidence for global warming.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>This visualization shows the annual global temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2025, along with 5-year and 10-year moving averages. The clear upward trend, especially since the 1970s, demonstrates the reality of global warming. The linear trend line indicates the average rate of warming over the entire period.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>Inspired by climate scientist Ed Hawkins, this visualization represents each year from 1880 to 2025 as a colored stripe, with blue for cooler years and red for warmer years. The progression from predominantly blue to predominantly red stripes provides a striking visual representation of global warming that is immediately understandable without requiring scientific expertise.</p>

                    <p>This bar chart shows the average temperature anomaly for each decade from the 1880s to the 2020s. The clear progression from cooler (blue) to warmer (red) decades illustrates the long-term warming trend. Error bars represent the standard deviation within each decade, showing the variability of temperatures.</p>

                    <p>These visualizations show how global warming affects different seasons. The left panel shows the warming rate for each season, indicating which seasons are warming faster. The right panel shows how average temperatures have changed across different time periods for each season, revealing that warming is occurring across all seasons but at different rates.</p>

                    <p>The top panel shows the 10 warmest and 10 coldest years in the record. Note that all of the warmest years have occurred recently, while all of the coldest years occurred in the early part of the record. The bottom panel shows the number of extremely warm years in each decade, with a dramatic increase in recent decades.</p>

                    <p>This visualization shows how the rate of warming has changed over time. Each point represents the warming rate (in Â°C per decade) calculated over a 30-year window centered on that year. The upward trend in recent decades indicates that global warming is not only continuing but accelerating.</p>

The clear separation between these periods, with each successive period showing higher temperatures, provides strong evidence for a consistent warming trend.</p>

                    <p>These boxplots show the distribution of temperature anomalies for each time period.
